# weather-dashbkoard

## Description 
HTML:
In HTML I linked my references to my js and also my script.js. I added cards to display the information from my weather api for the city the user searched. I added a search city text box and a history section to display the previous history and the previous cities visited are buttons to view those cities weather upon click. 

Javascript:
In Javascript I created variables for my local storage to display the history. I implemented jquery to loop the weather information across every card in my HTML. I created a function that gave me weather information for a city that was searched with the current day being the first and the next five days prior.
